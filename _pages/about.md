In 2007, I joined the faculty of the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at Hassan 2 University, Faculty of Science Ben M'Sik. FSB, From 2001 to 2006, I also taught computer Science at EMSI school, From 2002 to 2007, at the same time, I began to help students find internships and even jobs, I made a lot of relationships with companies, which facilitated the professional integration of our students, After completing my Ph.D. in 2006, I continued working at EMSI full-time until the end of 2007. My research interests are Computer Training, the Internet of Things, and Information Processing, more precisely:
1. The development of decision support algorithms: application in the biomedical field.
2. Improving and optimizing the performance of wireless communication networks.
3. The modeling of queue management for telecom networks, and more specifically in optical exchanges.
For further details, kindly visit my publications [webpage](publications/).

Previously, I worked for several years as a computer science teacher. Prior to working in the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, I completed my Ph.D. in the Department of Physics, and Information Processing at FSB. I was also a student at the same faculty and I liked it so much that I did not want to leave.
